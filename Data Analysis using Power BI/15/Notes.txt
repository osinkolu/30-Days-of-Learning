Day 15 started off with another momentum, Data storytelling with PowerBI, I spoke with a friend much recently that I hadn't worked with the Twitter API before or scrapped anything from Twitter. This was my chance! I was able to pull data from Twitter and use it for analysis.

Paul Nnakwe took the session on Data Storytelling with PowerBI, he gave very intelligent tips on colors in PowerBI dashboards. some of them I'll list below.

1. Use Brand colors
2. Limit the Dominant colors to 2
3. Use colors purposefully
4. Create accessible color schemes and test
5. If confused, use grayscales first.

He talked about Fonts, Size, and exploring beyond the defaults.

After the session, Paul created another ~2 hours of learning content on the PowerBI storytelling dashboard where we were able to do a deep dive: hands-on tweet analysis for the #30daysoflearning.
