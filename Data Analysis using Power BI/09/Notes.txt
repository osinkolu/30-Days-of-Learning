For the day 09 session, I was able to learn from one of the modules on the Microsoft learn portal, The module focused on power query with PowerBI, and how to clean, transform and load data in PowerBI. After the learning session there, I worked on the assignment on analyzing data from the web, the data comprises best and worst states to retire in the U.S. I found the data very interesting and was able to do some beautiful visuals on it.
