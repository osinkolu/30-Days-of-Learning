For Day 13, @theoyinbooke talked about his journey in Microsoft and how he was able to grow using Microsoft Technologies. The Microsoft Cloud skill challenge helped him a lot, pulling over 120 badges as at the time of writing, and over 25 trophies. Completing the modules on the Microsoft Cloud skill challenge is really cool, and the lessons and challenges are designed in a very engaging manner.

There are labs and practicals in the modules that test your knowledge as well. The Cloud skill challenge for the 30 days of Learning has a leaderboard where folks compete to finish the challenge first.
