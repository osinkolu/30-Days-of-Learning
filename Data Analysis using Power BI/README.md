## Day 01

Day 01 was great,🎇 it was fun to see that there are amazing auto dashboard generators in Microsoft Excel, excel is indeed a great tool for data analysis 🔥🔥. After the day 01 lessons, I'm excited to learn more in this data analysis track with a key focus on tools like excel and power BI.🥁

## Day 02

The lessons are actually packed and very informative😃, after this lesson, I no longer feel confident to put Microsoft Excel as a skill in my resume 😨. Microsoft Excel is indeed a powerful tool, and I'm just figuring out now that I haven't even scratched the surface in my so-called years of expertise 😩.

## Day 03

Day 03 entailed building a dashboard for covid 19 📉📊. I've always known that Microsoft excel could be used to do an analysis of some magnitude but seems I underestimated it. Microsoft Excel may be one of the most powerful data analysis tools there is 🤔 (not that I've seen much), but being a No-code solution for data analysis. It's more than impressive!😲

## Day 04

Day 04 was data visualization📉 at the click of a button🔲. Amazing right? Again I'm still stunned 😯 at what these platforms can do (maybe because I'm new to analysis with low-code solutions), but they are really amazing. I didn't even know you could add live dashboards 💹 to PowerPoint presentations💻, It's crazy!

I was able to set up PowerBI online and locally ⚙️, I also tested out the Teams data analysis. All these were done without really doing anything, the data already lives there and the BI tool can scramble the data and generate insights without doing anything at all.⚒️

It even has NLP tools to generate dashboards via questions❔ The "Power" 💪 in the "PowerBI" is no joke. Much respect to the creators of this tool.🙌🙌🙌


## Day 05

Day 05 is about "a day in the life of a data analyst". I got to meet(online)🧑‍💻 Olayinka and Debo. Pros in the data analysis space 🙌🙌. It was interesting to find out that their learning path was skewed and unofficial. They basically picked up an interest in the field and pursued it.🏃

Olayinka mentioned Stakeholder management as a very important skill for data analysts. Communication skill🤝 was also highlighted as another important skill to maximize your role as a data analyst.

It's not enough to build beautiful dashboards 📊, rather you have to see things from the perspective of someone who wants to solve problems and answer questions🎯.

## Day 06

Day 06 was more of a recap🕛 on what we've done through the last 5 days.5️⃣

## Day 07
I joined the Microsoft Cloud skill challenge for the Data Analysis track. The challenge has lots of learning content to upskill, and there's also a leaderboard that ranks 🎖️🏅 the participants. 

## Day 08
Day 08  was another interesting session hosted on Microsoft Reactor, I basically learned how to load data from different data sources🗄️. Microsoft PowerBI has a vast pool of connections it can make to the different data sources.

1. Sample dataset on the PowerBI desktop app
2. Using local excel files
3. Using SharePoint list.
4. From a folder that contains several data tables or spreadsheets.
5. Directly from the web
6. Pulling data from a database

After finalizing the session, I did some of the assignment📝 which was to create some visuals from the report📉. I created some visualizations from the sample financial report. A very basic visual.📊

## Day 09

For day 09 session 📆9️⃣, I was able to learn from one of the modules 🧰 on the Microsoft learn portal, The module focused on power query with PowerBI, and how to clean🧹, transform and load 🔃 data in PowerBI. After the learning session there, I worked on the assignment🗒️ on analyzing data from the web, the data comprises best and worst states to retire in the U.S. I found the data very interesting and was able to do some beautiful visuals on it.📊

## Day 10

Day 10 introduces us to the world of Data Modelling using Data Analysis Expression(DAX) 🛠️. A power-packed session by Ahmed Oyelowo 👨‍💻

We did a theoretical overview on the types of data and modeling 📈 then dived into the hands-on aspect 💪 where we looked into the super_store dataset. The dataset had 2 forms, normalized data, and denormalized data. To build the PowerBI dashboard📊, we loaded the normalized data with all the data segments on different file sheets🗒️. We were also introduced to relationships in PowerBI and how we could leverage them to create relationships 🤝 between different datasets in PowerBI. We attempted to create reports on:

1. sales by region 
2. sales by the manager

many times, there are redundant columns in your data and there's no need to keep all these data duplicated 🥚🥚, instead, we split the data into fact tables (continuous tables), and dimensions (static tables).

We also talked about the cardinality of relationships, one of the most popular is the "one-to-many" 🖇️. There was a clear understanding of how these relationships actually work under the hood.

## Day 11

Day 11 is about DAX, more like a continuation of day 10's 🔟 engagement. DAX is a language developed by Microsoft which contains a library of functions and operations.⚒️

One of the best use cases is to do custom calculations🧮 in PowerBI. We created a custom column by multiplying 2 columns together❎. Asides from creating new columns, DAX can also be used to create new tables.

Some of the DAX functions we tried out are:

1. Related
2. Calendarauto
3. Filter
4. SumX
5. Calculate
6. Previous month

Whilst creating the visuals 📊, I was able to understand the need to use measures 📏 rather than editing the data itself. Measures are powered by the filter 🥅 context and the filtering capabilities enable you to do more and toggle the whole report faster than doing a filter from one of the visualizations.📉

There are tons of functions in DAX, and sometimes the expressions get confusing, 😕 nevertheless, I had to follow very closely to get the full understanding.💫

## Day 12

Unfortunately, the session for this date is still unavailable at the time of writing.

## Day 13

For Day 13, @theoyinbooke🧑‍💻 talked about his journey in Microsoft🪟 and how he was able to grow using Microsoft Technologies. The Microsoft Cloud skill challenge helped him a lot, pulling over 120 badges🎖️ as at the time of writing, and over 25 trophies🏆. Completing the modules on the Microsoft Cloud skill challenge is really cool, and the lessons and challenges are designed in a very engaging manner.

There are labs and practicals 📒 in the modules that test your knowledge as well. The Cloud skill challenge for the 30 days of Learning has a leaderboard where folks compete to finish the challenge first.🥇

## Day 14

Day 14 was a recap of our learning experience🔁 , Some folks were featured who have had an awesome time learning in the past 13 days. One thing I can testify to is that the Microsoft 30 days of Learning is one of the best learning paths I've passed through🤗.

## Day 15

Day 15 started off with another momentum🤘, Data storytelling🗣️ with PowerBI, I spoke with a friend much recently that I hadn't worked with the Twitter🐥API before or scrapped anything from Twitter. This was my chance! I was able to pull data from Twitter and use it for analysis.💹

Paul Nnakwe 🧑‍💻 took the session on Data Storytelling with PowerBI, he gave very intelligent tips on colors🎨 in PowerBI dashboards. some of them I'll list below.

1. Use Brand colors
2. Limit the Dominant colors to 2
3. Use colors purposefully
4. Create accessible color schemes and test
5. If confused, use grayscales first.

He talked about Fonts, Size, and exploring beyond the defaults. After the session,🤝 Paul created another ~2 hours of learning content 🧑‍🏫 on the PowerBI storytelling dashboard where we were able to do a deep dive: hands-on tweet analysis for the #30daysoflearning.🧑‍🎓

## Day 16

Day 16 was another self-paced🤵 learning session with the Microsoft Cloud Skills Challenge🎖️, I took a module on Creating a data-driven story with Power BI reports📊. The module covered most of what paul taught on day 15, and even more.

## Day 17

Day 17 is another awesome content 🗒️ from @theoyinbooke 🤵 with talks centered around using the PowerBI service⚒️. The focus was to push a dashboard to the PowerBI Online service. We built a quick report📊 on the Kaggle cars 🚗dataset and then published it to the PowerBI service. I was also able to understand the difference between a dashboard and a report. 

Finally, we made a quick dashboard by pinning certain visuals to the dashboard.📌

## Day 18

Day 18 was another power-packed 💪session hosted by @theoyinbooke with the discussion 🗣️centered around the data refresh schedule📋 in PowerBI. Talks were centered around direct query🎯 and import method⤴️, these are ways to import data into PowerBI, the import method imports the data and does not refresh automatically🔃, but the DirectQuery method does not import the data, instead, it reads directly from the source.

We also talked about Data Gateway 🚪which helps to make on-premise data available online through a secure tunnel 🕳️in a bid to keep the data visualizations running.🏃‍♂️

## Day 19

We've come a long way 🛣️ and learned a lot in such a short time⌛, Day 19 brought in a pro in the data security field Adewale Yusuf who took us on Row level security🔐 in data analysis. The general idea of what the RLS does is to streamline what you want someone to see👀. For instance, if you'll like to share🤝 a repost for 3 different departments in the organization, you don't need to build 3 different reports,📊📊📊 instead, you'll have to take advantage of the RLS to make this possible with a single report📊. You can access the RLS in PowerBI by clicking on "Modelling">> "Manage roles"

There is also a dynamic RLS 🚴 where you can filter access based on the user's credentials.💳 We were introduced to some more Dax functions:

- Username, UserPrincipalName and lookup value

With this, you can set viewing preferences based on email,📧 etc.

Asides from all these, you can also create a very advanced RLS,⚓ and of course, some of these are what differentiates a beginner🧑‍🎓 from an intermediate🧑‍🏫. Another RLS we used was lookup, where we used the Dax function to check if the user was a manager or not, and provided viewing access based on his level.🔗

## Day 20

Day 20 was generally used to catch🪝 up on the learning content, to cover any skipped days or other things we would love to explore.🏃‍♂️

## Day 21

Day 21 was generally a feedback📢 session on discord, a time to connect with folks, and share overall insight on the journey thus far.🌅

## Day 22

As we Wrapped up the 30 days of learning, participants 🤵were expected to work on a project📑 that would help them demonstrate all the things learned in the course of the program with proper 🧾documentation on GitHub.📌

## Day 23

Day 23 - Capstone project📚

## Day 24

Day 24 - Capstone project📚

## Day 25

Day 25 - Capstone project📚

## Day 26

Day 26 - Capstone project📚

## Day 27

Day 27, and we've approached the end🔚 of the program,🧑‍💻 participants connected with Microsoft Ambassadors 🤵in their various universities. It was a great time to reflect and share the testimonies of the learning experience.🤝

## Day 28

Day 28 was about Catching Up and Sharing what we've learned on twitter and social media.

## Day 29

Day 29 - We updated our profiles📃 and I felt so confident🤵💼 in using PowerBI💹. I'll be doing a lot of analysis and PowerBI reports📊 for fun in times to come, and as the days go by. watch my Twitter space.😜

## Day 30

Graduation!!!!🎓 I'm really excited,😀 whew! now I can cross PowerBI off ☑️ my list and make reports like a Pro!🧑‍💼
