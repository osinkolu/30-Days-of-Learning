Day 08  was another interesting session hosted on Microsoft Reactor, I basically learned how to load data from different data sources. Microsoft PowerBI has a vast pool of connections it can make to the different data sources.

1. Sample dataset on the PowerBI desktop app
2. Using local excel files
3. Using SharePoint list.
4. From a folder that contains several data tables or spreadsheets.
5. Directly from the web
6. Pulling data from a database

After finalizing the session, I did some of the assignment which was to create some visuals from the report. I created some visualizations from the sample financial report. A very basic visual.
