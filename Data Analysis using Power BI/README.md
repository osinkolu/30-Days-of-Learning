## Day 01

Day 01 was great,🎇 it was fun to see that there are amazing auto dashboard generators in Microsoft Excel, excel is indeed a great tool for data analysis 🔥🔥. After the day 01 lessons, I'm excited to learn more in this data analysis track with a key focus on tools like excel and power BI.🥁

## Day 02

The lessons are actually packed and very informative😃, after this lesson, I no longer feel confident to put Microsoft Excel as a skill in my resume 😨. Microsoft Excel is indeed a powerful tool, and I'm just figuring out now that I haven't even scratched the surface in my so-called years of expertise 😩.

## Day 03

Day 03 entailed building a dashboard for covid 19 📉📊. I've always known that Microsoft excel could be used to do an analysis of some magnitude but seems I underestimated it. Microsoft Excel may be one of the most powerful data analysis tools there is 🤔 (not that I've seen much), but being a No-code solution for data analysis. It's more than impressive!😲

## Day 04

Day 04 was data visualization📉 at the click of a button🔲. Amazing right? Again I'm still stunned 😯 at what these platforms can do (maybe because I'm new to analysis with low-code solutions), but they are really amazing. I didn't even know you could add live dashboards 💹 to PowerPoint presentations💻, It's crazy!

I was able to set up PowerBI online and locally ⚙️, I also tested out the Teams data analysis. All these were done without really doing anything, the data already lives there and the BI tool can scramble the data and generate insights without doing anything at all.⚒️

It even has NLP tools to generate dashboards via questions❔ The "Power" 💪 in the "PowerBI" is no joke. Much respect to the creators of this tool.🙌🙌🙌


## Day 05

Day 05 is about "a day in the life of a data analyst". I got to meet(online)🧑‍💻 Olayinka and Debo. Pros in the data analysis space 🙌🙌. It was interesting to find out that their learning path was skewed and unofficial. They basically picked up an interest in the field and pursued it.🏃

Olayinka mentioned Stakeholder management as a very important skill for data analysts. Communication skill🤝 was also highlighted as another important skill to maximize your role as a data analyst.

It's not enough to build beautiful dashboards 📊, rather you have to see things from the perspective of someone who wants to solve problems and answer questions🎯.

## Day 06

Day 06 was more of a recap🕛 on what we've done through the last 5 days.5️⃣

## Day 07
I joined the Microsoft Cloud skill challenge for the Data Analysis track. The challenge has lots of learning content to upskill, and there's also a leaderboard that ranks 🎖️🏅 the participants. 

## Day 08
Day 08  was another interesting session hosted on Microsoft Reactor, I basically learned how to load data from different data sources🗄️. Microsoft PowerBI has a vast pool of connections it can make to the different data sources.

1. Sample dataset on the PowerBI desktop app
2. Using local excel files
3. Using SharePoint list.
4. From a folder that contains several data tables or spreadsheets.
5. Directly from the web
6. Pulling data from a database

After finalizing the session, I did some of the assignment📝 which was to create some visuals from the report📉. I created some visualizations from the sample financial report. A very basic visual.📊

## Day 09

For day 09 session 📆9️⃣, I was able to learn from one of the modules 🧰 on the Microsoft learn portal, The module focused on power query with PowerBI, and how to clean🧹, transform and load 🔃 data in PowerBI. After the learning session there, I worked on the assignment🗒️ on analyzing data from the web, the data comprises best and worst states to retire in the U.S. I found the data very interesting and was able to do some beautiful visuals on it.📊
